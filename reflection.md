- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
Cafe Class: I decided to overload the class constructor and the restock method. The class constructor was to be used if there were set amounts of coffee supplies instead of the user inputting the number. I created an overload for the restock method and made it public with set numbers, so if the user wanted to restock the supplies, they could without checking if they were out of supplies or not. 
House Class: I overloaded the class constructor and the moveIn method. The class constructor was for houses that didn't have an elevator or a dining room, so the class can just ignore them. The overloaded moveIn method allows the user to include the age of the resident moving in, to provide more database information for what year they were when the resident moved into the house.
Library Class: I overloaded the class constructor and the addTitle method. The class constructor was for creating libraries that had no elevator. The overloaded addTitle method allowed users to add a title to the collection, regardless of if the title was or wasn't currently available.  
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think the overload and override coding was a lot simpler than I thought. It was cool to see the code coming together in the campus map class. I think I had trouble with the goToFloor() the most, since the variety of condition statements was a little confusing to me.
